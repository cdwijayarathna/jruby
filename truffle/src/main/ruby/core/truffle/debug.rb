  module Debug

    # Break and enter an interactive shell.
    # @return [nil]
    #
    # # Usage
    # 
    # In the shell you can type normal Ruby expressions and have them evaluated
    # in the current frame. Results will be printed via `#inspect`, like in
    # IRB.
    # 
    # Extra commands available are:
    #
    # * `continue` leave the interactive shell and continue execution
    # * `exit` exit the VM
    # * `backtrace` print a backtrace, with numbered frames
    # * `frame n` make the nth frame active for expressions that you type into
    #   the shell (see +backtrace+ to find the frame you want)
    #
    # # Example
    #
    # In your ruby code call `Truffle::Debug.break` where you want to break.
    # When that method is called you will see the shell:
    #
    # ```
    # > backtrace
